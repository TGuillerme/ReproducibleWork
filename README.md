# Open Research & FAIR Data: A Day for Reproducibility and Transparent Workflows

## Workshop pitch:

We are going to try to sort out a repository to make it reusable and reproducible to adhere to FAIR data principles.
The idea here is to learn tips and tools to facilitate this workflow so that you can apply it to your current project or to your future projects.
This is not about criticising or ranking who does or doesn't do reproducible workflows!

We will be looking at three main aspects:

 1. Writing instructions for people to reproduce your work (for other workers and for future you!): the README file.

 2. Sharing your data and code so that everyone can re-use it and understand it (mainly future you!).
 
 3. The future of your repository. The afterlife of all projects.

 4. Discussing open research culture in your group

### Use your own project!

For this workshop we will be using the work of Elle Quinn that's wrapping up her masters project on the global distribution of new diversity metrics. In very brief: Elle is looking how different diversity metrics (species richness, functional diversity and traits innovation and elaboration) are distributed across the globe for all birds species and whether some spatial distribution patterns correlate with human activities. 

For the purpose of this workshop though, we won't need to know much of the details and the methods used in her excellent work. Here we will use a version of her work repository that we slightly modified for illustrating the points we want to teach. **We really encourage you to apply what we are going to learn today directly to your own project or, to a project you are thinking of starting so you get the good habits early**. If you don't have a project you want/can currently work on, you can use a simplified copy of Elle's work [here](https://github.com/TGuillerme/ReproducibleWork/tree/main/Example_repo/). If you don't have a laptop or just want to listen, you can pair up with a colleague in the room!

The exercise here will not be about correcting anyone's work (especially Elle's) but rather in rearrange files and adding description so that the work will be easier to share and reproduce in the future.

# 1 - Writing instructions for people to reproduce your work

For this section we will be using legos! In groups will be building some lego structures along with a README file. We then destroy the lego and give it to another group with the README file to see if they can reproduce your instructions.

This activity takes around 30 minutes.

# 2 - Sharing your data so that everyone can re-use it and understand it
 <!-- TODO: metadata README workshop from ZZ + open discussion on how to deal with big data (e.g. with Elle's data) -->
For the data:
<!-- TODO: ZZ -->
<!-- TODO: add question on how do you share huge data files? E.g. if there is already a >10GB database online from which you need only a small modified subset? If you don't know, you can go on the [Sheffield Data Management website](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/research-data-management) -->

For the code: there is a gradient between just sharing your raw uncommented code ([like this](https://github.com/liamrevell/phytools/blob/master/R/plotSimmap.R)) and creating a fully reproducible code that comes with a time machine and an emulator that automatically installs.
Where is the fine line in between these two extremes?
What are the actual essentials? (libraries, paths, versions, comments?) [here is the BES reproducible code guide](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf).

This activity takes around 30 minutes.

# 3 - The future of your repository. The afterlife of all projects.

 * What license do I choose for my work? [List of creative commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/)
 * Where do I store my work? [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/), [FigShare](https://figshare.com/), [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/)
 * Do I need a doi? [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
 * What are the requirements/help/tips from the University of Sheffield.
 * If I need to update my data or code? How do I do that?

This activity takes around 30 minutes.

# 4 - Discussing open research culture in your group.

 * Are people following open research practices in your group?
If yes, do you find it easy to follow?
If you don't know, what aspects of open research are not clear?
If not, is it something you would like to implement but don't know?

 * If your lab doesn't do open research but you want to do it, how to you go around applying it?

This activity takes around 30 minutes.
